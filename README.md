# AI_Adaptive_POW

To protect the client-server architecture from a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack we present
AI Adaptive POW. The Proof Of Work (POW) framework is open-source, modular, and customizable. The
framework has been developed using Java Springboot Framework and Python. AI Adaptive POW protects an
organization by injecting latency during communication. This is done by generating client reputation adaptive
puzzles, which need to be solved by a client before the server begins processing a request. The framework adap-
tively tunes the difficulty of a puzzle based on a reputation score calculated by an AI model. The framework
improves the defensive posture of an organization by slowing down the volume of incoming adversarial traffic.
Additionally, the framework compels the adversary to incur a cost per connection, hence making it expensive
for an adversary to sustain a volumetric DDoS attack.
